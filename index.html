        A timeline of events that shaped India’s journey towards Independence:
        </u>
      </h3>
      <ul id = "bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Revolt of 1857</strong> - considered as the first rebellion against the colonial power. This saw a handing of the reigns from the, then ruling, East India Company, to the British monarchy, in 1858. 
          </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Formation of the Indian National Congress in 1885</strong> - over the following decades, this political party played a crucial role in the fight for freedom.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>'Mahatma' Gandhi returns to India in 1915 </strong> - had Gandhi not returned from South Africa (after studying Law there) the Freedom struggle would have most certainly taken on an entirely different shape. Respected as the 'Father of the Nation', Gandhi's role in leading India to Independence is undeniable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The 1917 Champaran <em>Satyagraha</em> </strong> - Gandhi leads an uprising of farmers belonging to the village of Champaran, who were forced to grow a commercial crop called Indigo, without adequate compensation in return. 'Satyagraha' (which actually means 'holding on to truth') was coined as a term to symbolise a form of passive poltical resistance (spearheaded by Gandhi) against the British rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</strong> - the British government announced a ban on public gatherings to reprimand Indians for their 'disobedience'. However, unaware of this, thousands had amassed at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, on April 13, to celebrate the festival of <em>Vaisakhi</em>. Troops were ordered to open fire leading to the brutal massacre. This event sparked the start of a 'Non Cooperation Movement' the following year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Cooperation Movement of 1920</strong> - Gandhi became the leader of the Congress party and drove this protest. It was non-violent by nature, and saw people boycotting British products for those of local artisans and handicraft makers; as well as, refusing to pay taxes. However, the movement was later abandoned in 1922, when a protest turned violent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creation of the <em>Azad Hind Fauj </em> (Indian National Army) in 1943</strong> - this army was formed during the Second World War, by Indian prisoners of war (who fought on behalf of the British), with the aim of giving a ‘final push’ towards liberating India from British rule. It was formed and mobilised by the radically thinking freedom fighter and activist Subhas Chandra Bose.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>India’s Independence and subsequent partition in 1947</strong> - The UK parliament passed the Indian Independence Act in July, 1947. This came at a cost however, as British India was to be divided into India and Pakistan. The Act, finally came into effect later that year, and the newly formed nations of Pakistan and India were declared independent on 14th and 15th August, respectively.
